1. Occupancy Patterns and Environmental Conditions:

- How do temperature, light intensity, sound levels, and CO2 levels correlate with room occupancy?
- Can we identify optimal environmental conditions that promote comfort and productivity based on occupancy data?

2. Weekday vs. Weekend Effects:

- How do sensor readings vary between weekdays and weekends?
- Are there significant differences in occupancy or environmental factors?

3. Sensor Correlations and Redundancy:

- Are there redundant sensors based on correlation analysis?

4. Anomalies and Outlier Detection:

- Are there outliers in sensor readings that indicate equipment malfunction or unusual environmental conditions?
